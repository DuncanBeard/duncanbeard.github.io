I’ve owned duncanbeard.com for years now, and the most use I got out of it was a slick email address. I’ve tried creating a personal site more times than I can count, and the bit that always comes back to bite me is I’m not a UX developer. Making nicely designed things has never been my forte, whether posters in school, attempts at movies, or websites. So, this aversion to freeform design has stymied my efforts to pursue another area of interest for me — writing.

Just like being told what to read at school, being told what to write made me not want to do it. I would begrudgingly throw together an acceptable paper at the last minute in high school, and somehow that was good enough. In college, I wrote maybe a half-dozen papers total, so I never honed my craft. When a dreaded writing assignment came up, I struggled through it, then moved on. Having been out of school for a few years now, I’ve written even less.

When I’ve tried to start a website or blog before, I’ve gotten stuck in the technical side of it (what if I ran it on Raspberry Pis? What if I ran it on Kubernetes? What if I ran it on Raspberry Pis running Kubernetes!?), and never actually gotten it up, running, and filled with content. So to any potential employers out there, please don’t take my use of basic WordPress templates to mean I lack technical skill! I’m using it because I could set it up in under an hour and get writing.

My favorite short form works to read are opinion pieces and reviews of various sorts, so that’s what I’ll focus on here, at least to start. I don’t expect much in the way of traffic or views, I really just want a place to publish what I write.

I hope you enjoy reading it.

Cheers,

Duncan
